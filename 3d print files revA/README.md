## Blade Angles

These two blog posts are great resources for understanding the angles involved with ha-ganna and kumiko. The TL;DR is that the angle of the blade is not the same as the angle of the kumiko leaves that you cut.

My folder and file names refer to the angle of the kumiko pieces being cut. I bought my blades from Pro Shop Hokuto, available in this catalog: [Pro Shop Hokuto Catalog](https://www5e.biglobe.ne.jp/~ttoishi/sub55.html).  

In Google Translate, navigate to the section called **Leaf Plane (葉鉋)**, where you will find four blades for sale. The first one is the **Gomagara plane (ゴマガラ鉋)**, which has a blade angle of 60 degrees. This blade corresponds to my 45-degree angle.  

The blog posts describe well how the final kumiko leaf angle is a function of three factors:  
1. The blade angle  
2. The blade tip edge angle  
3. The bedding angle  

In Jon's blog, his bedding angle remains constant. However, with a 3D-printed part, I tuned these angles to achieve the desired 45-degree cut by adjusting the bedding angle. This was largely due to my inability to sharpen the blade tip at precise angles, so I kept the tip edge angle relatively unchanged.  

There may be some inconsistencies in blade angles from the manufacturer, so these 3D-printed parts may not work for every blade. I refined my design through an iterative process:  
1. Printing a sleeve  
2. Making a test cut  
3. Measuring the result  
4. Adjusting and reprinting the sleeve at a different bedding angle  
5. Repeating the process until I achieved the desired angle  

### Blade Angle Reference Table

The table below shows how the Pro Shop Hokuto blade angles correspond to my 3D-printed filenames. The filenames match the final kumiko leaf angles produced.
