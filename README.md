##Background: 
Kumiko is a labour intensive Japanese woodworking technique consisting of assembling wooden lattices and small wood strips cut at specific angles to form geometric patterns.  With my introductory knowledge of kumiko, the small wooden strips seems to be the bottleneck of the kumiko making process.  Looking online on how to make kumiko, it seems the popular method is to have a jig and chisel setup to cut at the specific angles required to make certain patterns. However, this process seems impossible to scale up if we're trying to make large kumiko panels, whch was what I aimed to do.
There are very few resources on how to make this, but there's one blog, Big Sand Woodworking(https://www.bigsandwoodworking.com/ha-ganna-%E8%91%89%E9%89%8B-making-dai/). In my opinion, this was the only valuable English online resource that talks about making ha-ganna planes and without it, I would never even attempted to try.  These planes seem like a more scalable method for making these delicate kumiko pieces.  
In his blog, Jon talks about the process of precisely chiseling out the dai to embed the specialty kumiko blades. I know my limitations as a novice woodworker that this was an impossible task for me as all I can do is make straight cuts with a table saw.  Still really wanting to try my hand at kumiko, I wanted to try and find a comprimise making most of the dai in wood and 3d printing the sleeve to hold the blade. After a trip to Japan to visit the shop that was recommended in the blog (seemingly one of the few places that sells these blades), I came home with 4 kumiko blades and $800 less money.

## The kumiko sleeve
The sleeves are printed in PETG. It's a pretty common material and is tougher and more forgiving than PLA, which is nice as it allows the blade to dig into the material without fracturing.
Initially, This was a one-part sleeve, but I split it down the middle into two to make it easier to assemble and disassemble the blade from the sleeve.  It's held together by 4 countersink M4 screws into 4 threaded inserts that are pressed into the other half.  The inner two threaded inserts are installed, which are used to secure it to the main dai. 

## The dai
I feel like 3D printing a tool like this is somewhat cheating and taking a shortcut already. I could have 3D printed the entire ha-ganna plane, but it didn't feel natural. I thought it was still necessary that the bulk of the material still had to be wood and when using the tool, all i touch is wood.  The dai and fence is made really simple. The main body is a rectangular block with a rectancular cutout to fit the sleeve. The height of the this dai is larger than the height of the sleeve to allow for changing the depth of cuts into kumiko pices. There are slotted holes to also adjst for the height. 
I made one change to the fence from the standard ha-ganna design.  The inner "meat" of the fence is cut away. Because my dai is wider than most to accomodate the 3d-printed sleeve, ergonomically, it was difficult to use. I cut away the fence material so that it was easier to hold the plane. 
Any edge of the dai that would come into contact with the hand, I would sand down a bit to make it a little more ergonomic. 
To assemble the sleeve to the dai, I hammered down the sleeve into the cutout. Once satisfied with how far the blade protruded from the bottom, the sleeve was secured with M4 screws and washers. 
1/4"-20 threaded rods cut to appropriate lengths (maybe 5-6")were fixed into the main body of the dai. I initially thought I would need to glue or epoxy this into place, but I drilled a pilot hole in the dai, threw the stud into a drill chuck, and screwed it in as far as it could go and didn't feel the need to epoxy it in. 
After drilling out clearance holes in the fence, I assembled the adjustable fence with 1/4"-20 thumb wheels and wing nuts. Note that the thumb wheel in the picture was bought from Pro Shop Hokuto as well, but if you search for a 1/4"-20 thumb wheel off amazon (https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0CBS7FMNL?psc=1&ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_ct_1GQ78TA57NBRHJTYNX91), it would work just the same. The top of the wheel should sit above the top of the dai.

## Background

Kumiko is a labor-intensive Japanese woodworking technique that involves assembling wooden lattices and small strips cut at precise angles to form geometric patterns. With my introductory knowledge of kumiko, I believed cutting these small wooden strips was the  bottleneck of the kumiko-making process.

When learning about different methods of making these small kumiko *leafs*, the most common approach seemed to be using a jig and chisel setup to cut pieces at the required angles. However, this method seemed impractical for scaling up production, especially if I wanted to create the large kumiko panels that I admired.

There are very few resources available on making kumiko planes, but one particularly valuable blog post from **Big Sand Woodworking** ([link](https://www.bigsandwoodworking.com/ha-ganna-%E8%91%89%E9%89%8B-making-dai/)) provided insight into the process. In my opinion, this was the only valuable English resource online discussing ha-ganna planes, and without it, I would have never attempted to try kumiko. With these ha-ganna planes, making large kumiko panels seemed for feasible, but how does one acquire or make these planes if no one sells them (at a reasonable price)?

In his blog, Jon describes the process of chiseling out the *dai* to embed specialty kumiko blades. As a novice woodworker, I knew this level of precision was beyond my skill set as I can really only make straight cuts with a table saw. Still determined to try kumiko, I wanted to find a compromise: making most of the *dai* from wood while 3D printing a sleeve to hold the blade.  This blog mentions a shop in Japan that sells kumiko blades, **[Pro Shop Hokuto](https://www5e.biglobe.ne.jp/~ttoishi/sumurai.index.html)**. So, I went and bought the four available kumiko blades they had and started planning.

## The Kumiko Sleeve

The sleeves are 3D printed in **PETG**, a common 3D printing material that is tougher and more forgiving than alternatives like PLA. This flexibility is useful since it allows the blade to dig into the material without fracturing.

Initially, the sleeve was designed as a **one-piece part**, but I later split it into **two halves** to make it easier to assemble and disassemble the blade. The two halves are held together by **four countersunk M4 screws**, which thread into **four pressed-in threaded inserts**. The inner two threaded inserts also serve to secure the sleeve to the main *dai*.

## The Dai

I feel like 3D printing a tool like this is already a shortcut, so I resisted the idea of printing the entire *ha-ganna* plane. It didnâ€™t feel right. I wanted most of the tool to be made from wood, so that when using it, I would primarily be touching wood.

The *dai* and fence are designed to be as simple as possible. The main body is a **rectangular block with a cutout** to fit the sleeve. The height of the *dai* is **greater than the sleeve height**, allowing for depth adjustments when cutting kumiko pieces. Slotted holes provide additional height adjustments.

I made one key modification to the **fence** compared to standard *ha-ganna* designs: I **removed material from the inner section**. Since my *dai* is wider than usual to accommodate the 3D-printed sleeve, it was ergonomically difficult to use. Removing material from the fence improved the grip and handling.

To improve ergonomics, I also sanded down any edges of the *dai* that would come into contact with my hands.

I don't believe these blades are manufactured precisely the same. I went through an iterative process to get the angles right for my specific set of blades. These files should serve as a guideline on how to 3D print a sleeve to make ha-ganna planes, and fine-tuning is almost certainly necessary for each set of blades.
